great job!

I see that you can print values correctly, perfect! maybe if you want to print each millisecond instead of updating its value each second, one possible way to go would be having two separated functions that call a setInterval, one every 1000 milliseconds and another every 1 ms.
But don't worry about it, everything is done great:)
